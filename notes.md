# Clarifying Questions:
- For u-turn, what happens if no allies are close and is it forced
- Low kick should clarify user or target's size
- Does STAB affect status moves targeted on self/etc
- Does Grudge have a duration
- Can Double Team copies be identified, where is the clone created
- How long does snatch last
- Does pin missile use attack modifier
- What happens if a foe moves out of range on a move like Fly/Sky Drop

- Priority (declare your intent to use priority before your turn, you may then go)
- Healing (move power is not used for damage, instead you heal that amount)
- Absorbing (you heal half the damage the target takes)
- Multihit (you attack twice, second hit is halved damage)
